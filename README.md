# ObjectDetectionBasedOnColor
Object detection and tracking are the task that is important and challenging such as video surveillance and vehicle navigation.Image processing is a method of extracting some useful information by converting image into digital inform by performing some operations on it. 
In the attached codes one code is for finding HSV value. So, that we can find the HSV value of any color and according to that hue saturation value of both upper and lower.
In the other code we have eneterd those HSV value of that specific color and then we convert the frames we take input form camera and convert it into HSV and I've also drawn two circles on that object.
